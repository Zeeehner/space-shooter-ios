A simple 2D space shooter game built with Swift and SpriteKit.

> ⚠️ This project is in early development.  
> So far, it includes:
> - A neon-style start screen with a PLAY button  
> - A playable endless shooter screen  
> - Player spaceship with touch movement  
> - Bullet firing with working collision (enemy hit = explosion)  
> - Enemies spawn randomly and move downward  
> - Scrolling background effect

❌ No score, no health, and no player-enemy collision yet.
